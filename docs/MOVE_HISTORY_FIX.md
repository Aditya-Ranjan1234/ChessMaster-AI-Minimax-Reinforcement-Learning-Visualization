# Move History Context Fix

## üéØ **Problem Identified:**

The LLMs were treating each move as if the game just started because they lacked **move history context**. This caused:

- **Repetitive moves**: LLMs kept suggesting the same opening moves
- **Poor game progression**: No understanding of what happened before
- **Hallucination**: Suggesting moves that were already played

## ‚úÖ **Solution Implemented:**

### **Added Move History to Prompts:**

Both `local_llm.py` and `groq_interface.py` now include:

```python
# Get move history for context
move_history = []
for i, move in enumerate(board.move_stack):
    move_history.append(f"{i+1}. {move.uci()}")
move_history_str = ", ".join(move_history) if move_history else "No moves played yet"
```

### **Enhanced Prompts:**

**Before:**
```
Given the current chess position in FEN format: {fen_string},
- Legal moves: {legal_moves}
- Evaluate the position...
```

**After:**
```
Given the current chess position in FEN format: {fen_string},
- Move history: 1. g1h3, 2. e7e5, 3. h3g5
- Legal moves: {legal_moves}
- Evaluate the position...
```

## üèÜ **Expected Improvements:**

1. **Better Game Understanding**: LLMs now know what moves were played
2. **Reduced Repetition**: Won't suggest moves that were already made
3. **Improved Strategy**: Can build on previous moves
4. **Fewer Hallucinations**: Context helps generate more relevant moves

## üìä **Example Context:**

**Move 1**: `1. g1h3` (White plays knight)
**Move 2**: `1. g1h3, 2. e7e5` (Black responds with pawn)
**Move 3**: `1. g1h3, 2. e7e5, 3. h3g5` (White moves knight again)

Now the LLM understands the game progression and can make informed decisions!

## üöÄ **Ready to Test:**

```bash
python resume_tournament.py
```

The LLMs should now play much more coherent games with proper move progression and fewer hallucinations.
