# Problems and Solutions for Chess LLM System

## Current Problems

1. **Poor Move Generation by LLMs**
   - LLMs repeat moves, lack chess understanding, and get stuck in loops.
2. **Inadequate Prompting Strategy**
   - Prompts do not encourage strategic, tactical, or positional play.
3. **Fallback to Random Moves**
   - When LLMs fail, the system picks random legal moves, leading to chaos.
4. **No Position Evaluation**
   - LLMs do not evaluate board positions, so cannot distinguish good from bad moves.
5. **No Opening Book**
   - Early moves are random, not following chess opening principles.
6. **Repetition and Draws**
   - Games end in draws due to repeated positions and lack of progress.

## Solutions

1. **Enhanced Prompting**
   - Improve prompts to include:
     - Position evaluation
     - Strategic objectives
     - Opening principles
     - Tactical awareness
2. **Better Move Selection**
   - Instead of random fallback, implement:
     - Simple evaluation function
     - Move ordering by piece values
     - Basic tactical awareness
3. **Opening Book**
   - Add an opening book to guide early game play and avoid random openings.
4. **Position Evaluation**
   - Implement a simple evaluation function to guide move selection when LLMs fail.
5. **Repetition Detection**
   - Add logic to detect and avoid repetitive patterns before they become threefold/fivefold repetitions.

**Core Issue:**
The current LLM implementations are too basic and don't understand chess strategy, leading to poor move quality and repetitive patterns that naturally result in draws.
