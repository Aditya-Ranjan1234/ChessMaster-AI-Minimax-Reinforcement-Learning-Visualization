# No Fallback Tournament System

## 🎯 **Pure LLM Performance Testing**

This tournament system has been configured for **pure LLM performance testing** with **NO FALLBACK SYSTEMS**. This means:

### ❌ **Removed Fallback Systems:**

1. **No Evaluation Function Fallback**
   - Previously: If LLM failed, used material evaluation
   - Now: If LLM fails, it loses the game

2. **No Random Move Fallback**
   - Previously: If LLM failed, picked random legal move
   - Now: If LLM fails, it loses the game

3. **No Repetition Avoidance**
   - Previously: Prevented repeating last 4 moves
   - Now: LLMs can repeat moves (natural behavior)

4. **No Invalid Move Recovery**
   - Previously: Invalid move format → random move
   - Now: Invalid move format → immediate loss

### ✅ **What This Means for Your Research:**

- **Pure LLM Performance**: Only the LLM's chess understanding is tested
- **Real Hallucination Impact**: When LLMs hallucinate, they lose immediately
- **No Artificial Help**: No evaluation functions or random moves helping models
- **True Model Comparison**: Direct comparison of LLM chess capabilities

### 🏆 **Tournament Structure:**

**TinyLlama-1.1B** (with state tracking) vs **Large LLMs**:
- Groq Llama-3.3-70B-Versatile (70B parameters)
- Groq Llama-3.1-8B-Instant (8B parameters)  
- Groq Gemma2-9B-IT (9B parameters)

**60 games total** - Each model plays both white and black

### 📊 **Research Metrics:**

- **Win/Loss/Draw ratios** (pure LLM performance)
- **Hallucination frequency** (when models fail to generate valid moves)
- **Game length** (shorter games = more decisive play)
- **Move quality** (no artificial help)

### 🚀 **Running the Tournament:**

```bash
# Test setup
python test_setup.py

# Start tournament
python run_chess_tournament.py

# Resume if paused
python resume_tournament.py
```

### 🎯 **Expected Results:**

With no fallbacks, you should see:
- **More decisive games** (models lose when they hallucinate)
- **Clearer performance differences** between model sizes
- **Pure hallucination impact** on game outcomes
- **True test** of whether state tracking helps tiny models vs large ones

This setup will give you the **most accurate data** on whether tiny models with state tracking can outperform larger LLMs that hallucinate more frequently.
