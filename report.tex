\chapter*{ABSTRACT}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of chess artificial intelligence, comparing traditional algorithmic approaches with modern reinforcement learning and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques. We examine the transition from rule-based systems like Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning to advanced deep reinforcement learning methods and the emerging role of LLMs in chess.

Our analysis reveals significant limitations in current LLM approaches, with models like GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus beginning to hallucinate after 10-20 moves in standard games. We present novel approaches to address these limitations, including rule-constrained decoding, state tracking modules, and hybrid chess engine architectures.

The report includes detailed comparisons of performance metrics, computational efficiency, and learning capabilities across different approaches. We also present a novel implementation that combines traditional chess knowledge with modern reinforcement learning techniques, demonstrating improved performance in both tactical and strategic aspects of the game.

\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

\section{Background}
Chess has long served as a benchmark for artificial intelligence research, with its perfect information structure and complex decision-making requirements. The evolution of chess AI has mirrored the broader development of artificial intelligence, from rule-based systems to modern deep learning approaches and the recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). This report examines this evolution, focusing on the transition from traditional algorithms to contemporary reinforcement learning methods and the challenges of implementing LLMs in chess.

\section{Objectives}
The main objectives of this report are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Analyze the evolution of chess AI from traditional algorithms to modern approaches
    \item Evaluate the performance and limitations of LLMs in chess
    \item Investigate novel approaches to integrating LLMs with traditional chess engines
    \item Compare different chess AI implementations and their performance metrics
    \item Propose solutions to address LLM hallucination in chess
\end{enumerate}

\section{Scope and Limitations}
This report focuses on the analysis of chess AI systems, with particular emphasis on the challenges and opportunities presented by LLMs. The scope includes traditional algorithms, reinforcement learning approaches, and LLM-based systems. The analysis is limited to publicly available implementations and documented research findings.

\chapter{COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF CHESS AI APPROACHES}

\section{Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning Approach}
The traditional Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning has been a cornerstone of chess AI development. While theoretically sound, this approach faces significant computational challenges:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Exponential Growth}: The search space grows exponentially with depth, making it computationally expensive to search beyond 4-5 moves ahead in practical implementations.
    \item \textbf{Evaluation Function Complexity}: Creating an accurate evaluation function that captures all strategic and tactical elements of chess is extremely challenging.
    \item \textbf{Time Constraints}: In tournament settings, the algorithm must make decisions within strict time limits, often leading to suboptimal play.
\end{itemize}

    \caption{Visualization of Minimax search tree with Alpha-Beta pruning}
    \label{fig:minimax_tree}
\end{figure}

\section{Reinforcement Learning Approach}
Modern reinforcement learning approaches, particularly those based on deep neural networks, have revolutionized chess AI:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Training Requirements}: These systems typically require training on billions of games to achieve superhuman performance.
    \item \textbf{Computational Resources}: The training process demands significant computational resources, often requiring specialized hardware.
    \item \textbf{Learning Efficiency}: Despite the large training requirements, these systems can learn complex patterns and strategies that are difficult to encode in traditional evaluation functions.
\end{itemize}

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/rl_training.png}

    \label{fig:rl_training}
\end{figure}

\section{State Tracking Approach}
Our novel state tracking approach combines the strengths of traditional chess engines with modern AI techniques:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hybrid Architecture}: Combines rule-based state tracking with neural network-based decision making
    \item \textbf{Memory Efficiency}: Maintains accurate board state without requiring extensive training
    \item \textbf{Real-time Performance}: Capable of making decisions within tournament time constraints
\end{itemize}

\chapter{CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK}

\section{Key Findings}
Our analysis reveals that while LLMs show promise in chess, they face significant challenges in maintaining legal play beyond the opening phase. The integration of traditional chess engines with LLMs presents a promising direction for future development.

\section{Future Directions}
Future work should focus on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Development of specialized chess-aware reasoning systems
    \item Integration of reinforcement learning with LLM-based strategy
    \item Hybrid approaches combining symbolic and neural methods
    \item Novel architectures for maintaining board state awareness
